    <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q1: What is the purpose of the `Player` class?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A1: The `Player` class represents a player in the game, managing their name, food supply, and pets. It provides methods for interacting with pets, such as feeding, playing, and resting them.</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q2: How does the `addPet` method work?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A2: The `addPet` method adds a given pet to the player's list of pets. It accepts a `Pet` object as an argument and appends it to the `pets` ArrayList.</p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q3: What does the `feedPet` method return?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A3: The `feedPet` method returns `true` if the pet was successfully fed, which occurs if the player has food and the pet index is valid. It returns `false` if the feeding operation fails (e.g., insufficient food or invalid pet index).</p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q4: What happens when the player feeds a pet?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A4: When the player feeds a pet, the pet's `feed()` method is called, and the player's food supply is reduced by 1.</p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q5: How does the `playWithPet` method work?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A5: The `playWithPet` method checks if the provided pet index is valid and, if so, calls the pet's `play()` method, simulating playtime with the pet.</p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q6: How is the player's food supply managed?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A6: The food supply starts at 50. It can be decreased by feeding pets using the `feedPet` method and can be increased using the `addFood` method.</p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q7: What does the `getStatus` method return?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A7: The `getStatus` method returns a string that describes the player's current state, including their name, food supply, and a list of all their pets with their individual statuses.</p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q8: Can the player have multiple pets?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A8: Yes, the player can have multiple pets, as they are stored in an `ArrayList` of `Pet` objects.</p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q9: What would happen if a player tries to feed a pet with no food left?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A9: If the player has no food left, the `feedPet` method will return `false` because the condition `foodSupply > 0` is not satisfied.</p>
    
    <p><span class="question">Q10: How is the food supply updated?</span></p>
    <p><span class="answer">A10: The food supply is updated by subtracting 1 when feeding a pet. It can also be increased using the `addFood` method, which adds the specified amount to the current food supply.</p>
